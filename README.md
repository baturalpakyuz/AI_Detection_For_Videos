AI Video Detection System

A web-based platform for real-time detection of AI-generated videos, combining Nginx, Sightengine's AI API, and a hybrid PHP/Python/Flask backend. Designed for security, content moderation, and abuse prevention. It is important that this project has not been proven to correctly evaluate all the videos. This project is decided in February 2024 and finished in May 2024.

Features
- Real-Time Analysis: Instant frame-by-frame AI detection via Sightengine
- Modular Architecture:
  * Nginx web server for static assets and reverse proxying
  * PHP frontend for UI rendering
  * Flask (Python) API wrapper for AI integration
- Low Latency: Optimized pipeline for rapid video processing
- Cross-Platform: Windows-compatible deployment

git clone https://github.com/baturalpakyuz/AI-Gen_VideoCheck.git
cd ai-video-detection

2. Configure Components

NGINX Setup
-----------------
1. Navigate to Nginx directory (default: C:/nginx)
cd C:/nginx

2. Start Nginx server
start nginx

PHP-CGI Initialization
----------------------
